# Rārangi

    1. (verb) (-tia,-hia) to list, arrange, itemise. 
    2. (noun) line, rank, row, queue, list, catalogue.

## Description

This is just a toy project to experiment with separating the framework (Rails or Sinatra), persistence (AR, memory, etc) and business logic.

## TODO

1. Figure out how can use migrations as Rails native migrations (copy?)
2. Authentication (can we add Devise on top of our user model).
